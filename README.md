(Work In Progress) JavaScript for the Tech Pubs Document Management SharePoint subsite.

This project is my current project. I am working on building a SharePoint site for my government organization, in which I am building it from scratch using HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript (unfortunately, the DoD still uses Internet Explorer and it does not take kindly to ES6 JavaScript...).
Now, it is highly worth noting that I had no prior experience working with the SharePoint framework. I have been learning as I go, which is one of the primary reasons I believe this project best showcases my skills and ability to adapt to/overcome any challenge that is thrown my way.
